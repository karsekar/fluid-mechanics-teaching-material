# Fluid Mechanics Teaching Material

by Karthik Sekar

This material was used for active learning-based teaching of junior-level Fluid Mechanics at Northwestern University in the Fall 2013. The students started with an empty template and "filled" in along with the instruction. Within every directory is a '.tex' file and corresponding note template (pdf file) generated using pdflatex. Also included is a filled example for each lecture in the appropriate directory. This material was designed to be used with the book "Process Fluid Mechanics" by Morton Denn (ISBN:  0137231636). Big acknowledgements to Wesley Burghardt who wrote the original material from which these notes were based.

I hope that these notes are useful to any Fluid Mechanics teachers/learners and that more can be added to this github. I also apologize in advance for my chicken scratch in the filled templates, but maybe that forces more learning.
